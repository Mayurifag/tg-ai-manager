# Messages queue

## To show on web interface

We have to queue all messages

## To autoread or skip or delete or else

Before message goes to AI we can:

- Skip if author is user account
- Skip if message has specific link or regexp on words

## Not to forget

- Index (composite?) on chat_type (forum/channel/user) and its id for messages
  to see inclusion
