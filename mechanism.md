# Messages queue

## To add for global autoskip

- Skip if event is group enabling/disabling private messages.

## Not to forget

- Index (composite?) on chat_type (forum/channel/user) and its id for messages
  to see inclusion
- What if we have completely new chat? We have to follow only whole logics.
  Maybe we can actually implement new logics which will autodelete and autoban
  scam messages. Not sure of this. Maybe waywayway later on future.
