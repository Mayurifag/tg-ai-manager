# Messages queue

## To show on web interface

We have to queue all messages

## To autoread or skip or delete or else

Before message goes to AI we can:

- Skip if author is user account
- Skip if message has specific link or regexp on words

## Not to forget

- Index (composite?) on chat_type (forum/channel/user) and its id for messages
  to see inclusion
- What if we have completely new chat? We have to follow only whole logics.
  Maybe we can actually implement new logics which will autodelete and autoban
  scam messages. Not sure of this. Maybe waywayway later on future.
